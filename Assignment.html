			<blockquote cite="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/">
			"Dachshund" is a German word meaning "badger dog," and the breed's German history
			goes back some 600 years. And, as the breed name suggests,the Dachshund was
			developed to enthusiastically dig his way into a badger den and dispatch its
			occupant. The Dachshund's long, low body was custom-made for this subterranean
			work.
